# integrations-worker

Cloudflare Worker for the integrations bounded context — provider connections (GitHub App first), inbound delivery inbox, repo links, and the installation-token broker

Part of the signalpilot runtime: a Cloudflare Worker deployed per
environment (`stage`, `prod`; `dev` is verify-only). Not publicly routable — reached only through `api-edge` service bindings.
